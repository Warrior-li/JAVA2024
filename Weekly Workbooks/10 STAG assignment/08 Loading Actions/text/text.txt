We have provided some example action files for you to use in your project.
Firstly there is a <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/basic-actions.xml" target="_blank">basic actions file</a>
to help get you started in constructing your game engine.
We have also provided an <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-actions.xml" target="_blank">extended actions file</a>
that can be used for more extensive testing during the later stages of your work.

Both of these documents are written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
In order to successfully parse these XML files, you should use the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP).
In particular, you should make use of the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilder.html" target="_blank">DocumentBuilder</a>
class as well as various classes from the 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml/org/w3c/dom/package-summary.html" target="_blank">org.w3c.dom</a> package.
See the "Hints and Tips" section of this task for an example of how to use these classes.

Once loaded in from the XML file, you should store the actions in a suitable in-memory data structure so that your server can access them quickly and easily.
