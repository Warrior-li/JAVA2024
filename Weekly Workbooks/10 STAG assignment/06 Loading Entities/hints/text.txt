To ensure that the entities file is in the correct location in the project folder and that it can be accessed by the DOT parser,
we have provided a <a href="resources/cw-stag/src/test/java/edu/uob/EntitiesFileTests.java" target="_blank">JUnit test class</a> for you to use.
Not only will this test script verify that the entities file is readable, it ALSO provide a practical illustration of how to use of the JPGD library for parsing DOT files.

You may assume that all entity files used during marking are in a valid format (our aim isn't to test the robustness of the parsing libraries).

A `.jar` file containing the JPGD library can be found in the `libs` folder of the maven template.
This _should_ already be part of the project dependencies, but it is useful to know where the library resides
(Just in case you find that you have add it manually to your IntelliJ project).
