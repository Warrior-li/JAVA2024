This workbook introduces the final assignment that is worth the remaining 60% of the assessment for this unit. The focus of this assignment is the construction of a general-purpose socket-server game-engine for text adventure games. A typical game of this genre is 'Zork' (illustrated in the screenshot shown below). The following sections of this workbook explain the construction of this Simple Text Adventure Game (STAG) in more detail and provide a breakdown of the features that you are required to implement.
As usual, a <a href="resources/cw-stag/" target="_blank">maven template project</a> has been provided for you to help get you started in this assignment.

Note that this assignment will be marked on the lab machines, so it is essential that you check that you
can compile and run your code using Maven on these machines before submission.

In order to identify the use of "derived" code (i.e. material "found" online or generated by AI), we will again make use of code similarity checking tools.
Any code that has been determined to have been derived will be discounted during the marking process (resulting in a reduced final mark).
Remember that you will only receive credit for code that YOU yourself have written.

You are encouraged to talk about the assignments and discuss possible high-level implementation approaches with other students.
HOWEVER it is **essential** that you protect your own work (and don't share code with any other students).
With this in mind, never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, GIT, forums, printouts, photos or any other means).
If you ask a question on the unit discussion forum, try to keep discussion at a high level
(i.e. not pasting in chunks of your code). If it is unavoidable to include code, only share
small fragments of the essential sections you need assistance with.
In addition, avoid the use of pair programming on this unit - you must produce all your own work !
Students submitting very similar work will be treated as collusion and will be dealt with using the university academic integrity processes.
