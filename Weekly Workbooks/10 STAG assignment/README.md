## STAG assignment
### Task 1: Introduction


This workbook introduces the final assignment that is worth the remaining 60% of the assessment for this unit. The focus of this assignment is the construction of a general-purpose socket-server game-engine for text adventure games. A typical game of this genre is 'Zork' (illustrated in the screenshot shown below). The following sections of this workbook explain the construction of this Simple Text Adventure Game (STAG) in more detail and provide a breakdown of the features that you are required to implement.
As usual, a <a href="resources/cw-stag/" target="_blank">maven template project</a> has been provided for you to help get you started in this assignment.

Note that this assignment will be marked on the lab machines, so it is essential that you check that you
can compile and run your code using Maven on these machines before submission.

In order to identify the use of "derived" code (i.e. material "found" online or generated by AI), we will again make use of code similarity checking tools.
Any code that has been determined to have been derived will be discounted during the marking process (resulting in a reduced final mark).
Remember that you will only receive credit for code that YOU yourself have written.

You are encouraged to talk about the assignments and discuss possible high-level implementation approaches with other students.
HOWEVER it is **essential** that you protect your own work (and don't share code with any other students).
With this in mind, never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, GIT, forums, printouts, photos or any other means).
If you ask a question on the unit discussion forum, try to keep discussion at a high level
(i.e. not pasting in chunks of your code). If it is unavoidable to include code, only share
small fragments of the essential sections you need assistance with.
In addition, avoid the use of pair programming on this unit - you must produce all your own work !
Students submitting very similar work will be treated as collusion and will be dealt with using the university academic integrity processes.

### Task 2: Illegal Constructs


Each year we like to vary the nature of the coursework assignments a little (in order to avoid totally replicating assignments from previous years).
In past years we have: adjusted the features that need to be implemented; adapted the testing mechanisms that must be used; prescribed specific development processes.
In order to make this year's assignments different, we need to find a new angle on creating "variation".
For this reason, we are introducing a set of "illegal constructs" - these are core features of the Java programming language,
that you are NOT permitted to use in your code for this assignment. The illegal constructs for this year are as follows:

- Lambdas: Although lambdas `->` are a relative new and powerful feature of Java, you are not permitted to use them in this assignment. There are always alternatives to the use of lambdas - banning their use will encourage you to explore these alternatives.
- Arrays and ArrayLists: These are often the go-to data structures for many data manipulation activities. Banning their use will encourage you to explore a wider range of "exotic" data structures from the Java collections package. Note that you _may_ use the `args` array that is passed into the main method (since this is embedded in the language itself) ! Where an API you have been asked to use returns an `ArrayList` from a method call, you should not store this object at all, but rather _immediate_ request an iterator for that object.
- Ternary operators: These provide a shorthand for `if-then-else` control flow. We have banned their use because they can result in complex and potentially hard-to-read code. There are always alternatives to the use of ternary statements.
- Unqualified method calls: All methods must be called "on" an object (or a class). Skipping the object name is common practice when referring to the current object. This is however lazy programming, so you should ALWAYS call methods on `this` when invoking methods internal to an instance. For example, in your OXOController you would call `this.checkForWin()` rather than just `checkForWin()`.
- String concatenation: Joining strings together using the `+` operator is a common practice, however it can become inefficient when constructing complex strings (due to the overhead of implicit instantiation of intermediate String objects). We have banned the use of string concatenation in order to provide you with practice using more efficient string manipulation mechanisms (such as the `StringBuilder` class). Note that you may find the Java `printf` method useful for printing out strings without the need to use concatenation.

The above constraints may well feel like frustrating obstacles to you implementing your solution, however each has (at least some) justification for being made illegal.
It is good practice to gain experience developing code within language and stylistic constraints - it is rare that you have a totally free hand when implementing code in a real-world context.

We do not really _want_ to apply penalties to your mark, but rather we just want to _prevent_ the use of the above constructs in the first place.
In order to help you make sure that your code does not make use of any of the above illegal constructs, we have provided a source code checker for you to use. This checker is called `strange` (let's just say that it looks for *strange* behaviour in your code). You can run this checker from the command line using the maven `exec` command.
Note that checker will only check one source file at a time, so you will need to run it for each and every source file that you write.
For example, to check the `GameServer` class, you would issue the command:
```
./mvnw exec:java@strange -Dexec.args=src/main/java/edu/uob/GameServer.java
```
or on windows:
```
mvnw exec:java@strange -Dexec.args=src\main\java\edu\uob\GameServer.java
```
We have left a few illegal constructs in the template `GameServer` class that we have given you, so that you can practice using the `strange` checker.
If you run the above command, you should see a warning report similar to the one illustrated below.
Note that you will need to replace the flagged constructs with legal code *before* you submit your final version to Blackboard.

# 
### Task 3: Game Engine
 <a href='03%20Game%20Engine/video/adventure.mp4' target='_blank'> ![](../../resources/icons/video.png) </a>

The aim of this assignment is to build a versatile game engine that it is able to play _any_ text adventure game
(providing that it conforms to certain rules). To support this versatility, two configuration files:
**entities** and **actions** are used to describe the various "things" that are present in the game,
their structural layout and their dynamic behaviours.
These two configuration files are passed into the game server as parameters to the constructor method like so:

``` java
public GameServer(File entitiesFile, File actionsFile)
```

The server will load the game scenario in from the two configuration files, thus allowing a range of different games to be played.
During the marking process, we will use some custom game files in order to explore the full range of functionality in your code.
It is therefore essential that your game engine allows these files to be passed in and then reads and interprets their content
(otherwise we won't be able to test your code).

Once the configuration files have been loaded, your server will listen for incoming connections from clients (in a similar way to the DB exercise).
Again, the basic network operation has been provided for you in the template class. You will however need to add code to the `handleCommand` method
so that it will:
- receive an incoming command from a client
- process the actions that have been requested
- make changes to any game state that are required
- finally send a suitable response message back to the client

As with the DB assignment, you should build a robust and resilient server which will be able to keep running, no matter what commands the user throws at it.
Note that _unlike_ the DB assignment however, game state must NOT be made persistent between server invocations.
When the server starts up, the game state should be loaded in from the _original_ config files (do NOT update these with changes as the game progresses).
The server should NOT remember the state of any previous games, but should start afresh each time the server is run.

As with the DB exercise, a client has been provided for you for manual testing purposes.
It is again essential that you do not implement any features inside the client class (since this file will be discarded and
replaced by an automated test script during the marking process).

To execute the server from the command line, type `mvnw exec:java@server`.
To execute the client that will connect to the server, open up a NEW terminal window and type `mvnw exec:java@client -Dexec.args="simon"`
The `-Dexec.args` flag allows us to pass an argument into the client (in this case the username of the current player).

This username is then passed by the client to the server at the start of each command (so the server knows which player the command came from).
The client is provided for manual exploration and demonstration purposes - most of the time you will run your code
using a JUnit test script using `mvnw test` (or the green "run test" button from inside IntelliJ).

The video linked to at the top of this section provides a demonstration of a typical game session (from the perspective of the client).
Note that there is no audio track in this video - it is just a visual illustration.


  


**Hints & Tips:**  
Note that some command line interpreters have difficult parsing command line parameters.
If you run into problems running the client from your command line, try adding a space after the `-D` flag, for example:
`mvnw exec:java@client -D exec.args="simon"`
  


# 
### Task 4: Basic Commands


In order to communicate with the server, we need an agreed language
(otherwise the user won't know what to type to interact with the game !).
There are a number of standard "built-in" gameplay commands that your game engine should respond to:

- `inventory` (or `inv` for short) lists all of the artefacts currently being carried by the player
- `get` picks up a specified artefact from the current location and adds it into player's inventory
- `drop` puts down an artefact from player's inventory and places it into the current location
- `goto` moves the player from the current location to the specified location (provided that there is a path to that location !)
- `look` prints details of the current location (including all entities present) and lists the paths to other locations

It is essential that you conform to this standard set of commands, otherwise it will not be possible to play your game
(and your game engine will fail many of the marking tests !). To illustrate these commands in use (and to demonstrate
the expected responses) a few examples are included in an example test script that can be found in the maven project's test folder.

In addition to these standard "built-in" commands, it is possible to extend a game with additional "custom" game-specific **actions**.
These will be introduced in more detail in a later section of this workbook.

  


**Hints & Tips:**  
Note that built-in commands are reserved words and therefore cannot be used as names for any other elements of the command language.  


# 
### Task 5: Game Entities


Game **entities** are a fundamental building block of any text adventure game.
They are used to represent a wide range of different "things" that exist within a game including:

- Characters: Various creatures, animals, robots or people involved in game
- Players: A special kind of character that represents the user who is playing the game
- Locations: Rooms, environments or places that are present within the game
- Artefacts: Physical things within the game that can be collected by the player
- Furniture: Physical things that are an integral part of a location (which CANNOT be collected)

It is worth noting that **locations** are complex constructs in their own right and
have various different attributes including:
- Paths to other locations (note: it is possible for paths to be one-way !)
- Characters that are currently at a location
- Artefacts that are currently present in a location
- Furniture that belongs within a particular location

Entities are defined in one of the game configuration files using a language called 'DOT'.
This language can be used to express the structure of a graph (which is basically what a text adventure game fundamentally is !)

The big benefit of using DOT files to store game entities is that we can render them graphically
using existing visualisation tools (such as <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/" target="_blank">this</a>).
These tools allow us to actually SEE the structure of the game configuration
(for example, see the graphical representation of one of the entity files shown in the diagram below).
As you can see, each location is represented as a rectangular box containing a number of different entities
(each type of entity being represented by a different shape). The paths between locations are
presented in the form of directed "arrows" (what Computer Scientists call 'edges').  


![](05%20Game%20Entities/images/basic-entities.png)

# 
### Task 6: Loading Entities


We have provided a couple of example entity files to help you in your development work.
Firstly there is a <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/basic-entities.dot" target="_blank">basic entities file</a>
to help get you started in constructing your game engine.
We have also provided an <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-entities.dot" target="_blank">extended entities file</a>
that can be used for more extensive testing during the later stages of your work.

You already have much experience of writing parsers from previous exercises (both on this unit and others).
We don't really want to cover old ground, so for this assignment you will NOT be required to build your own parser.
Instead, you are able to use existing parsing libraries for reading in the configuration files.
This in itself if a useful learning opportunity - there is considerable educational value in learning to use
existing libraries and frameworks in this way.

With this in mind, you should use the
<a href="http://www.alexander-merz.com/graphviz/doc/com/alexmerz/graphviz/Parser.html" target="_blank">JPGD parser</a>
in order to parse the entity DOT files. Use this library to extract a set of 
<a href="http://www.alexander-merz.com/graphviz/doc/com/alexmerz/graphviz/objects/package-summary.html" target="_blank">GraphViz Objects</a>
from the entities file and then store them in a suitable data structure in-memory so that your server can access them.
We have provided you with an abstract `GameEntity` class in the maven project that you might like use to represent entities within your game.
You may wish to write additional concrete subclasses that inherit from this abstract class in order to represent specific types of entity.

All entities will need _at least_ a name and a description, some may need additional attributes as well.
To make the assignment a little easier, entity names cannot contain spaces (the DOT parser doesn't like it if they do !).
In addition to this, entity names defined within the configuration files will also be unique.
You won't have to deal with two things called `door` (although your might see a `trapdoor` and a `frontdoor`).
As such, you can safely use entity names as unique identifiers. In addition to this, entity objects should be unique within the game
(for example, there should only ever be one instance of the "axe" entity).

It is worth noting that every game has a "special" location that is the starting point for each player adventure.
The start location can be called anything we like, however it will _always_ be the **first** location that appears in the **entities** file.

Note that the `locations` subgraph will _always_ be **first** in the entities file and the `paths` subgraph will _always_
appear **after** the locations (the DOT parser doesn't like it if we switch this ordering !)

Finally, there is another special location called `storeroom` that can be found in the entities file.
This location does not appear in the game world (there will be no paths to/from it).
The `storeroom` is a container for all of the entities that have no initial location in the game.
Everything needs to exist somewhere in the game structure (so that they can be defined in the entities file).
These entities will not enter the game until an action places them into another location within the game.
There will _usually_ be a `storeroom` location in the **entities** file - since often there are unplaced entities at the start of the game.
(and the game writer will need to put them somewhere in the **entities** file).
If there isn't a `storeroom` location defined (maybe the game writer forgot or didn't need it), then your server should create one automatically.
  


**Hints & Tips:**  
To ensure that the entities file is in the correct location in the project folder and that it can be accessed by the DOT parser,
we have provided a <a href="resources/cw-stag/src/test/java/edu/uob/EntitiesFileTests.java" target="_blank">JUnit test class</a> for you to use.
Not only will this test script verify that the entities file is readable, it ALSO provide a practical illustration of how to use of the JPGD library for parsing DOT files.

You may assume that all entity files used during marking are in a valid format (our aim isn't to test the robustness of the parsing libraries).

A `.jar` file containing the JPGD library can be found in the `libs` folder of the maven template.
This _should_ already be part of the project dependencies, but it is useful to know where the library resides
(Just in case you find that you have add it manually to your IntelliJ project).  


# 
### Task 7: Game Actions


In addition to the standard "built-in" commands (e.g. `get`, `goto`, `look` etc.), your game engine should also
respond to any of a number of game-specific "custom" commands (as specified in the **actions** file).
Each of these **actions** will have the following elements:

- One or more possible **trigger** phrases (ANY of which can be used to initiate the action)
- One or more **subject** entities that are acted upon (ALL of which need to be "available" to perform the action)
- An optional set of **consumed** entities that are all removed ("eaten up") by the action
- An optional set of **produced** entities that are all created ("generated") by the action
- A **narration** that provides a human-readable explanation of what happened when the action is performed

Note that being "available" requires the entity to be _either_ in the inventory of the player invoking the action
_or_ for that entity to be in the room/location where the action is being performed. This feature is
intended to be a shortcut so that a player can use an entity in their current location _without_ having to explicitly pick it up first.
Any type of entity can be the 'subject' of an action (artefacts, locations, characters, furniture etc).

It is worth noting that action trigger keyphrases are NOT unique - for example there may be multiple "open" actions that
act on different entities. Note that trigger phrases cannot (and will not) contain the names of entities,
since this would make incoming commands far too difficult to interpret. Just consider the challenge of trying to
interpret the command: `lock lock with key`.

Upon receiving an action command, your server should attempt to find an appropriate matching action.
Note that the action is only valid if ALL **subject** entities (as specified in the actions file) are available to the player.
If a valid action is found, your server must undertake the relevant additions/removals (production/consumption).

When an entity is _produced_, it should be moved from its current location in the game (which might be in the `storeroom`)
to the location in which the action was trigged. The entity should NOT automatically appear in a players inventory -
it might be furniture (which the player can't carry) or it might be an artefact they don't actually want to pick up !

When an entity is _consumed_ it should be removed from its current location (which could be any location within the game)
and moved into the `storeroom` location. If the game writer wants to enforce co-location (i.e. that the consumed entity must be
in the same location as the player) then they must include that entity as a **subject** of the action.

Note that it is NOT possible to perform an action where any subject, consumed entity or produced entity is currently in
_another_ player's inventory. You should consider these entities "out of bounds" and not available to a player who does not
currently hold that artefact. You can't unlock a door if another player has the key !

Locations can be used as subjects as well as being consumed and produced entities of an action (just like other entities).
Consumed locations however are not moved to the storeroom - instead, the path between the current location and consumed location is removed
(there may still be other paths to that location in other game locations). For produced locations, a new (one-way) path is added from the
current location to the "produced" location.
  


# 
### Task 8: Loading Actions


We have provided some example action files for you to use in your project.
Firstly there is a <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/basic-actions.xml" target="_blank">basic actions file</a>
to help get you started in constructing your game engine.
We have also provided an <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-actions.xml" target="_blank">extended actions file</a>
that can be used for more extensive testing during the later stages of your work.

Both of these documents are written in eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
In order to successfully parse these XML files, you should use the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP).
In particular, you should make use of the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilder.html" target="_blank">DocumentBuilder</a>
class as well as various classes from the 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.xml/org/w3c/dom/package-summary.html" target="_blank">org.w3c.dom</a> package.
See the "Hints and Tips" section of this task for an example of how to use these classes.

Once loaded in from the XML file, you should store the actions in a suitable in-memory data structure so that your server can access them quickly and easily.  


**Hints & Tips:**  
To ensure that the basic actions file is in the correct location in the project folder and that it can be accessed by the XML parser,
we have provided a <a href="resources/cw-stag/src/test/java/edu/uob/ActionsFileTests.java" target="_blank">JUnit test class</a> for you to use.
Not only will this test script verify that the actions file is readable, it ALSO provides a practical illustration of how to use of the JAXP library
for parsing XML files.

You may assume that all action files used during marking are in a valid format (our aim isn't to test the robustness of the parsing libraries).
  


# 
### Task 9: Command Flexibility


Interpreting the input from users in this assignment is very different from dealing with queries in the DB exercise.
The simplified SQL that we used for the last assignment was limited, rigid and constrained.
As such, it was possible to write a reasonably concise BNF grammar to define the entire language.
The same is not true for natural language, which is very complex, permits much variation and is used diversely (depending on the speaker/writer).
The best we can hope do is to try to make our command interpreter as flexible and versatile as possible - in order to cope with most eventualities.
Below are various features your should implement in your interpreter to support such flexibility:

**Case Insensitivity**  
All commands (including entity names, locations, built-in commands and action triggers) should be treated as case insensitive.
This ensures that, no matter what capitalisation a player chooses to use in their commands, the server will be able in interpret their intensions.
For this reason, it is not possible for the configuration files to contain two different things with the same name, but different capitalisation
(e.g. there cannot be a `door` and a `DOOR` in the same game)

**Decorated Commands**  
In order to support command variability, your interpreter should be able to cope with additional "decorative" words being inserted into a command.
For example, the basic command `chop tree with axe` might well be entered by the user as `please chop the tree using the axe`.
Both versions are equivalent and should both be accepted by your command interpreter.

**Word Ordering**  
The ordering of the words in a command should not effect the server's ability to find appropriate matching actions.
For example `chop tree with axe` and `use axe to chop tree` are equivalent and should both be accepted by your command interpreter.

**Partial Commands**  
To further support flexible natural language communication, your server should be able to operate with shortened, "partial" commands.
It is convenient for the user to be able to omit _some_ of the subjects from a command, whilst still providing enough information for
the correct action to be identified.
For example, the command `unlock trapdoor with key` could alternatively be entered as _either_ `unlock trapdoor` _or_ `unlock with key` -
both of which provide enough detail for an action match to be attempted.
In order to stand a chance of matching a command to an action, each incoming command MUST contain a trigger phrase and _at least_ one subject.
Anything less than this and the intended action will probably be too vague to identify, so should be rejected by your command interpreter.

**Extraneous Entities**  
When searching for an action, you must match ALL of the subjects that are specified in the incoming command (e.g. `repair door with hammer and nails`).
Extraneous entities included within an incoming command (i.e. entities that are in the incoming command, but not specified in the action file)
should prevent a match from being made. This is to prevent the user attempting to perform actions with inappropriate entities
(e.g. `open potion with hammer` should not succeed). Similarly, specifying extraneous entities for built-in command (e.g. `get key from forest`)
should not be permitted. The rational for this is that it could be problematic for your command interpreter to determine which entity to perform
the built-in command upon if there is more than one in the command.

**Ambiguous Commands**  
Much of the above "fuzzy" matching of actions is risky - there may be situations where _more than one_ action matches a particular command.
If a particular command is ambiguous (i.e. there is _more than one_ **valid** and **performable** action possible)
then NO action should be performed and a suitable warning message sent back to the user
(e.g. `there is more than one 'open' action possible - which one do you want to perform ?`)

**Composite Commands**  
Composite commands (commands involving more than one activity) should NOT be supported.
Users are unable to use commands such as `get axe and coin`, `get key and open door` or `open door and potion`.
A single command can only be used to perform a single built-in command or single custom game action.

**Error messages**  
Note that due to the range of possible response messages it is possible to return to the user, we will not test for specific error/anomaly messages.
Rather, we will check the underlying game state using the standard built-in commands (`look`, `inv` etc) in order to check that inappropriate actions have not
been performed by your server. That said, we still encourage you to return suitable error messages to the user for the sake of playability of your game.

Although there is much flexibility and variability in the command language, the test cases we will use during the marking process
will focus upon testing user input that is "fair and reasonable".
We are interested in assessing the ability of the command interpreter to detect valid, sensible and likely inputs from the user.
This requires the user to provide enough information to allow the interpreter to uniquely identify an action,
whilst at the same time giving them some flexibility about how they go about expressing the command.
We aren't looking for the ability of the interpreter to deal with illogical or silly commands.
We just want to avoid the situation where the user thinks: "That was a fair command, why won't it understand me".
If the user types something weird and strange they shouldn't be surprised if something weird and strange happens as a consequence.

  


# 
### Task 10: Multiple Players


If you are feeling ambitious, extend your game so that it is able to operate with more than just a single player.
In order to support this feature, incoming command messages begin with the username of the player who issued that command.
For example, a "full" incoming message might therefore take the form of:
```
simon: open door with key
```

Where everything _before_ the first `:` is the player's name and everything _after_ is the command itself.
Valid player names can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, apostrophes and hyphens.
No other characters are valid and if they occur, a suitable error message should be returned to the user.

Note that there is no "formal" player registration process - when the server encounters a command from
a previously unseen user, a new player should be created and placed in the start location of the game.
There is no need for your server to implement any form of authentication - 
you can assume that the client handles this responsibility.
Your server should simply trust any commands that purport to come from a particular user.
This may seem unsafe, however this is intended to limit the scope and complexity of this assignment.

It is essential that when an incoming message is received, the command is applied to the _correct_ player.
To achieve this, you will need to maintain _some_ elements of game state _separately_ for each individual player.
For example, each player may be in a different location in the game and will carry their own inventory of artefacts.

One final thing to remember is that you should include _other_ players in your description of a location
when a `look` command is issued by a user. There is no point having multiple players in the game if they can't
actually _see_ each other ! Note that even though they can see each other, human players cannot interact directly.
This is because, due to the dynamic nature of player naming, it is not possible to write action rules involving player identifiers
(since a game writer can't predict what usernames players are going to choose in advance of the game being played !).  


# 
### Task 11: Player Health


As an extension to the basic game, you might like to add a "health level" feature.
Each player should start with the maximum health level of 3. Consumption of "Poisons & Potions" or interaction with beneficial
or dangerous characters will increase or decrease a player's health by one point. You will see in the 
<a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-actions.xml" target="_blank">extended actions file</a>
the use of the `health` keyword in the `produced` and `consumed` fields.
These indicate actions which increase and decrease your health by one unit.
Note that although a player's health can never increase above the maximum (i.e. 3)
actions producing health are still _performable_ but they will have no effect on the player's health level.

When a player's health runs out (i.e. when it becomes zero) they should lose all of the items in their inventory
(which are dropped in the location where they ran out of health).
The player should then be transported to the start location of the game and their health level restored to full (i.e. 3).
You might also like to send a suitable message to the user, for example:
```
you died and lost all of your items, you must return to the start of the game
```
It is important that you should not reset the whole game state when one player dies
(for example, previously opened location paths should still exist).
You should remember that there may be more than one player of the game - they shouldn't see their world change just
because another player has died.

In order to fully support these features in your game engine, you should implement a new `health` built-in command,
so that the player can keep track of their current health level. Upon receiving a `health` command from a user,
the server should report back the player's current health level (as a number).

  


# 
### Task 12: Marking


Note that this is an individual assignment, not a group activity ! Automated checkers will be used to flag partly (or fully) duplicate submissions from students in this year's cohort. If markers feel that collusion between students has taken place, the incident will be referred to an academic malpractice panel. The outcome of this panel may be a mark of zero for assignment or even the entire unit (if it is a repeat offence).

For consistency and compatibly with all test cases, it is essential that you adhere to the gameplay commands detailed in this workbook.
You should also ensure that you do not change the name of your main class - it must be called `GameServer`.
If you change the name of the class (or the `handleCommand` method) the marking script will not be able to test your code !
It is **ESSENTIAL** that you check your code still passes the original test script provided as part of the maven project.
If your code does not pass these basic tests, then it is likely your code will not pass any of the final marking tests.

Make sure your code does not contain anything specific to your computer (e.g. absolute file paths, operating system specific code etc).
Before submitting your code, we advise you to test your project on a computer _other than the one it was developed on_ (e.g. a lab machine).
Clear out all temporary files and then ensure the code compiles and runs correctly using Maven. We will apply a penalty mark if we cannot run your code
"out of the box" - we can't spend time fixing everyones projects before we mark them !

Note that the "quality" of your code will be taken into account when assessing your work.
The code quality metrics outlined earlier in this unit will be used to derive your final mark.
It is important therefore that you adhere to the structure and style guidelines outlined in the "code quality" workbook.
It is also essential that you take heed of the quality feedback you have received for previous exercises,
since this will help you improve your work - not just for this exercise, but in the long term.

Remember that your code MUST NOT use any of the banned "illegal" language constructs (namely: Lambdas, Arrays, ArrayLists, Ternary operators, Unqualified method calls, String concatenation). If you do use any of these illegal constructs in your submission, your assignment will receive a mark of zero ! Remember to use the `strange` tool to check that your source code does not make use of any illegal constructs.

Finally, remember that we will use automated analysis tools to determine "derived" code (material "found" online or generated by AI). You will only receive credit for code that YOU yourself have written.
