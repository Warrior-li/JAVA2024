Game **entities** are a fundamental building block of any text adventure game.
They are used to represent a wide range of different "things" that exist within a game including:

- Characters: Various creatures, animals, robots or people involved in game
- Players: A special kind of character that represents the user who is playing the game
- Locations: Rooms, environments or places that are present within the game
- Artefacts: Physical things within the game that can be collected by the player
- Furniture: Physical things that are an integral part of a location (which CANNOT be collected)

It is worth noting that **locations** are complex constructs in their own right and
have various different attributes including:
- Paths to other locations (note: it is possible for paths to be one-way !)
- Characters that are currently at a location
- Artefacts that are currently present in a location
- Furniture that belongs within a particular location

Entities are defined in one of the game configuration files using a language called 'DOT'.
This language can be used to express the structure of a graph (which is basically what a text adventure game fundamentally is !)

The big benefit of using DOT files to store game entities is that we can render them graphically
using existing visualisation tools (such as <a href="https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/" target="_blank">this</a>).
These tools allow us to actually SEE the structure of the game configuration
(for example, see the graphical representation of one of the entity files shown in the diagram below).
As you can see, each location is represented as a rectangular box containing a number of different entities
(each type of entity being represented by a different shape). The paths between locations are
presented in the form of directed "arrows" (what Computer Scientists call 'edges').
